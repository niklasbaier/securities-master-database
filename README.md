# Securities Master Database (SMD)

This repository holds the code that was used to build up a securities master database from scratch, utilizing the Yahoo Finance and Alpaca Trade APIs.
A detailed documentation & explanation of all parts of this repository can be read up [here](https://niklasbaier.github.io/me/building-up-a-securities-master-database/).

As this code was written back in 2021 and has not since been updated, I am not perfectly sure whether it still works as expected.
However, I will look into this and update this repository if need be (and also go over the code quality).
